# udnanoDSC01
This repository is created to solve the project for the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science. The project is a part of the Introduction to data science. 
In this project we solve a really simple data science project by looking at some datasets, coming up with a question and answering it. 
The results are then posted to Medium as a blog post in order to exercise our
ability to communicate complex information.

## File structure
The files within the project are the following

- jpNotebook.ipynb   : Jupyter notebook containing the results
- data/               : Folder contains the raw datafiles
- 


# Dataset
Description of the datset

## Research Question
What is our question for the dataset?


## Methodology
How are we going to answer the question?

## Results
What are the results?

# About Me
CuDeA  : Custom Design Algorithms is my attempt at setting up a consultancy/company that allows me to follow my passion. I hold a BS in Mechatroics Engineering and MSc in Electrical Engineering from Reykjavik University [Iceland]. There I fell in love with computation and engineering optimization, leading to do my MS thesis on nonlinear optimization. Since then I have been lucky to get jobs in research institutes, first at https://www.iiim.is/, currently at https://www.mining3.com/ where I have been able to hone my programming skills and problem solving for technical issues. 

I am doing this project to refresh my Data Science skills.
